# ISTE-NDN-Reddit-
## Description
The NDN Reddit project focuses on using the resources provided by the open source NDN framework to build APIs that allow us to mimic the functioning of reddit. The major difference between reddit and the proposed project is leveraging the strengths of NDN to build branches within subreddits allowing people to more easily access thier interests. We will then build an android app as well as a website using the backend we created using the NDN resources that will demonstrate the usage of our platform.
